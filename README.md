# cellulose_disturbance

R scripts for analysis+visulization of disturbance experiment of Lewin et al's cellulose enriched community

Sequencing data was processed with DADA2, then wrangled with Phyloseq.

Phyloseq objects were written out into data tables so I could graph myself.

Most visualization done with "disturbance_total_*_no2CDay5" files.

"pseudomonas_alignment.txt" was a quick alignment to verify same two Pseudomonas ASVs between the two Illumina runs.
